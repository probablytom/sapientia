mediaDescription: An essay about life and work

The essay by Merlin Mann, Cranking, has a profound impact on how I tend to think about work. I've only actually read it as of a couple of months ago, but it's had a big impact on me:

* I realised that my work-life balance was pretty shitty once I'd read this
* I think I begin to understand more the value of family, and the draw of having children, having read the essay. I'm not sure. It's given me lots to think about in this area.
* I want to spend less time "cranking", and much more time with the people I love. I also want to spend time doing the *things* I love, but not the things I don't, and that's okay.
